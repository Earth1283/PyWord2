# PyWord2
Reconinuation the old PyWord project but this time with PyQt5 and other external libraries
Still, I am aiming to keep the dependencies to a minimum
## Install dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal to install `PyQt5`
```bash
pip3 install PyQt5
```
try this if `pip3` does not work
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```
## Run the Program
Execute the program with
```bash
python3 /path/to/the/file/main.py
```
or
```bash
python /path/to/the/file/main.py
```
